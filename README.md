Gray: Automated ML Model Tracking & Optimization

Gray is a lightweight Python tool designed to eliminate the manual effort of tracking machine learning experiments. It provides a simple interface to automatically save, track, and retrieve your best-performing model hyperparameters using a MongoDB backend, helping you maintain a reproducible and optimized MLOps workflow.
The Problem
In machine learning development, we often run hundreds of experiments with different models and hyperparameters. Keeping track of which parameters led to which results can become a messy and error-prone task, often involving spreadsheets or manual text files. This makes it difficult to reproduce results and find the optimal configuration for a new task.
Gray solves this by creating a centralized, queryable history of all your model experiments.
Key Features
Automated Logging: With a single function call, automatically save your model's name, hyperparameters, and performance metrics.
Smart Retrieval: Query the experiment history to find the best hyperparameters for a given model type and task description.
Tag-Based Filtering: Use descriptive tags (e.g., "classification", "customer_churn") to organize and retrieve relevant models.
Framework Agnostic: Seamlessly integrates with any scikit-learn compatible model.
Simple Integration: Requires minimal setup to integrate into any existing ML pipeline.
